BONJSON: Binary Object Notation for JSON
========================================

BONJSON is a _hardened_, _lightning-fast_ and _efficient_, **1:1 compatible** binary drop-in replacement for [JSON](#json-standards).

It's **35 times** faster to process than [JSON](#json-standards).

It's also **far safer** than JSON:

* **Safe** against key collision attacks
* **Safe** against injection attacks
* **Safe** against truncation attacks
* **Safe** against numeric range attacks


Why use binary?
---------------

### Efficiency

Text formats are great for humans to read, but they're slow and wasteful for computers.

Computers should speak to humans in **text** (such as [JSON](#json-standards)), and to each other in **binary**.



Why use BONJSON?
----------------

### It's Small

* The [BONJSON specification](bonjson.md) is only 800 lines long (including the formal grammar).
* The [C reference implementation](https://github.com/kstenerud/ksbonjson/tree/main/library/src) is less than 500 LOC each for the encoder and decoder.

### It's Simple

* It doesn't use tricks like histograms or references or lookups. Leave those to _real_ compression algorithms.
* It uses existing, CPU-native data encodings as much as possible.
* It keeps tricky sub-byte data to a minimum.

### It's Safe

* **Safe** against key collision attacks
* **Safe** against injection attacks
* **Safe** against truncation attacks
* **Safe** against numeric range attacks

### It's Speedy

* Data encoding and decoding can be done using branchless algorithms ([example](https://github.com/kstenerud/ksbonjson/tree/main/library/src)).
* The most common data types and ranges are encoded in fewer bytes.
* The [C reference implementation](https://github.com/kstenerud/ksbonjson) is **35 times** faster than [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq).

Benchmarking [the C Reference Implementation](https://github.com/kstenerud/ksbonjson) vs [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) on a Core i3-1315U (using [this test data](https://github.com/kstenerud/test-data)):

**10MB:**

```
~/ksbonjson/benchmark$ ./benchmark.sh 10mb

Benchmarking BONJSON decode+encode with 9052k file 10mb.bjn

Benchmarking JSON decode+encode with 10256k file 10mb.json

real    0m0.340s
user    0m0.322s

```

BONJSON processed **35.8x** faster.

**100MB:**

```
~/ksbonjson/benchmark$ ./benchmark.sh 100mb

BONJSON processed **35.4x** faster.

**1000MB:**

```
~/ksbonjson/benchmark$ ./benchmark.sh 1000mb

Benchmarking JSON decode+encode with 1025564k file 1000mb.json

real    0m32.239s

BONJSON processed **35.6x** faster.



What about the other binary JSON-like formats?
----------------------------------------------

**None** of them are 1:1 compatible. None of them are safe. Most of them are overcomplicated.

* **Type Parity**: No extra data types that aren't present in [JSON](#json-standards)
* **Value Parity**: Allows only the same value ranges as [JSON](#json-standards) (for example: infinities and NaN are disallowed)
* **Feature Parity**: Supports the same features as [JSON](#json-standards) (for example: progressive document construction)
* **Safety**: Guards against common attack vectors (key collisions, truncation, range)
* **Endianness**: Big endian formats are slower to process on modern hardware

**Wherever there's a compatibility mismatch, breakage will eventually occur** - it's only a matter of time before your complex data pipelines trigger it.

Having confidence in your data plumbing is paramount.
