BONJSON: Binary Object Notation for JSON
========================================

BONJSON is a _lightning-fast_ and _efficient_ **1:1 compatible** binary drop-in replacement for [JSON](#json-standards).

BONJSON is **30 times** faster to process than [JSON](#json-standards).


Why use binary?
---------------

Text formats are great for humans to read, but they're slow and wasteful for computers. Computers should speak to humans in **text** (such as [JSON](#json-standards)), and to each other in **binary**.


Why use BONJSON?
----------------

### It's Small

* The [BONJSON specification](bonjson.md) is only 600 lines long (including the formal grammar).
* The [C reference implementation](https://github.com/kstenerud/ksbonjson/tree/main/library/src) is less than 500 LOC each for the encoder and decoder.

### It's Simple

* It doesn't use compression tricks like histograms or references or lookups. Leave those to the _real_ compression algorithms.
* It uses existing, CPU-native data encodings as much as possible.
* It keeps tricky sub-byte data to a minimum.

### It's Speedy

* Data encoding and decoding can be done using branchless algorithms ([example](https://github.com/kstenerud/ksbonjson/tree/main/library/src)).
* The most common data types and ranges are encoded in fewer bytes.
* The [C reference implementation](https://github.com/kstenerud/ksbonjson) is **34x** faster than [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq).

Benchmarking [the C Reference Implementation](https://github.com/kstenerud/ksbonjson) vs [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) on a Core i3-1315U (using [this test data](https://github.com/kstenerud/test-data)):

What about the other binary formats?
------------------------------------

**None** of them are 1:1 compatible. Most of them are overcomplicated.

| Encoding | Type Parity | Value Parity | Feature Parity | Endianness |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------- |
| BONJSON  |      ‚úîÔ∏è      |      ‚úîÔ∏è       |        ‚úîÔ∏è       |   Little   |
| BSON     |      ‚ùå     |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Little   |
| UBJSON   |      ‚úîÔ∏è      |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Big      |
| BJData   |      ‚ùå      |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Little   |
| PSON     |      ‚ùå     |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Unclear  |
| Smile    |      ‚ùå     |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Big      |

* **Type Parity**: No extra data types that aren't present in [JSON](#json-standards)
* **Value Parity**: Allows only the same value ranges as [JSON](#json-standards) (for example: infinities and NaN are disallowed)
* **Feature Parity**: Supports the same features as [JSON](#json-standards) (for example: progressive document construction)
* **Endianness**: Big endian formats are slower to process on modern hardware

**Wherever there's a compatibility mismatch, breakage will eventually occur** - it's only a matter of time before your complex data pipelines trigger it. Having confidence in your data plumbing is paramount.
