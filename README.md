BONJSON: Binary Object Notation for JSON
========================================

BONJSON is a **1:1 compatible** binary serialization format for [JSON](#json-standards).

It's a drop-in replacement that works in the same way and has the same capabilities and limitations as [JSON](#json-standards) (no more, no less), in a compact and simple-to-process binary format rather than text.



Why make a binary JSON?
-----------------------

[JSON](#json-standards) isn't going anywhere, so let's at least be more efficient where we can!

BONJSON documents are quicker and more energy efficent to process, and are generally smaller and compress better than JSON.

Machine-to-machine transmission is better done in binary, with conversion to human-readable JSON only where a human actually needs to be involved.


### Why not BSON or anther existing binary JSON format?

Because they _all_ add extra things that make them **NOT** 1:1 compatible.

| Encoding | Type Parity | Value Parity | Feature Parity | Endianness |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------- |
| BONJSON  |      ‚úîÔ∏è      |      ‚úîÔ∏è       |        ‚úîÔ∏è       |   Little   |
| BSON     |      ‚ùå     |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Little   |
| UBJSON   |      ‚úîÔ∏è      |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Big      |
| BJData   |      ‚úîÔ∏è      |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Little   |
| PSON     |      ‚ùå     |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Unclear  |
| Smile    |      ‚ùå     |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Big      |

* **Type Parity**: Meaning the format has no extra data types that aren't present in JSON
* **Value Parity**: Meaning the format allows only the same value ranges as JSON (for example: infinities and NaN are disallowed)
* **Feature Parity**: Meaning the format supports the same features as JSON (for example: progressive document construction)

**Wherever there's a compatibility mismatch, breakage will eventually occur** - it's only a matter of time before your complex data pipelines trigger it. Having confidence in your data plumbing is paramount.

**1:1 compatible means that**:

 * Any valid document **MUST** be round-trip convertible between [JSON](#json-standards) and the binary format (in either direction) without data loss or schema requirement.
 * The binary format **MUST** support the same feature set as [JSON](#json-standards) does. For example, JSON supports progressive encoding.

A binary version of JSON **MUST** behave in exactly the same way as [JSON](#json-standards). The _only_ difference should be in the encoding mechanism.

**_This_ is what BONJSON is.**


### Why use binary at all?

A simple binary format is orders of magnitude faster to produce and consume compared to a text format, and has a smaller data footprint.

**Most systems follow a similar progression of data needs**:

| Stage                               | Data Choice                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| New project                         | JSON, because it's simple and ubiquitous and piss simple to debug. |
| Your costs begin to rise            | JSON-compatible binary format, because it's (hopefully) a drop-in replacement for JSON, with lower processing and transmission costs (such as BONJSON). |
| Your needs expand beyond basic data | A more advanced binary format specific to your use case (such as Protobufs). |



BONJSON is Small, Simple, and Efficient
---------------------------------------

BONJSON's format is designed to be simple (the [C reference implementation](#implementations) is less than 500 LOC each for the encoder and decoder), and compact where it makes sense to do so. This means:

 * No built-in compression (dictionaries, lookups, etc). Leave that to the _real_ compression algorithms.
 * Prefer existing, ubiquitous encodings as much as possible.
 * Encode the most likely data using the smallest encoding overhead.
 * Be computationally simple for 99.99% of real-world data.
