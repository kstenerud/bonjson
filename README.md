BONJSON: Binary Object Notation for JSON
========================================

BONJSON is a **1:1 compatible** binary serialization format for [JSON](#json-standards).

It's a drop-in replacement that works in the same way and has the same capabilities and limitations as [JSON](#json-standards) (no more, no less), in a compact and simple-to-process binary format that is **30x faster** to process.



Why make a binary JSON?
-----------------------

[JSON](#json-standards) isn't going anywhere, so let's at least be more efficient where we can!

BONJSON documents are quicker and more energy efficient to process, and are usually smaller than JSON.

Machine-to-machine transmission is better done in binary, with conversion to human-readable JSON only where a human actually needs to be involved.


### Why not BSON or anther existing binary JSON format?

Because they _all_ add extra things that make them **NOT** 1:1 compatible (and more complicated).

| Encoding | Type Parity | Value Parity | Feature Parity | Endianness |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------- |
| BONJSON  |      ‚úîÔ∏è      |      ‚úîÔ∏è       |        ‚úîÔ∏è       |   Little   |
| BSON     |      ‚ùå     |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Little   |
| UBJSON   |      ‚úîÔ∏è      |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Big      |
| BJData   |      ‚ùå      |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Little   |
| PSON     |      ‚ùå     |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Unclear  |
| Smile    |      ‚ùå     |      ‚ùå      |        ‚ùå      |   Big      |

* **Type Parity**: Meaning the format has no extra data types that aren't present in JSON
* **Value Parity**: Meaning the format allows only the same value ranges as JSON (for example: infinities and NaN are disallowed)
* **Feature Parity**: Meaning the format supports the same features as JSON (for example: progressive document construction)

**Wherever there's a compatibility mismatch, breakage will eventually occur** - it's only a matter of time before your complex data pipelines trigger it. Having confidence in your data plumbing is paramount.

**1:1 compatible means that**:

 * Any valid document **MUST** be round-trip convertible between [JSON](#json-standards) and the binary format (in either direction) without data loss or schema requirement.
 * The binary format **MUST** support the same feature set as [JSON](#json-standards) does. For example, JSON supports progressive encoding.

A binary version of JSON **MUST** behave in exactly the same way as [JSON](#json-standards). The _only_ difference should be in the encoding mechanism.

**_This_ is what BONJSON is.**


### Why use binary at all?

A simple binary format is orders of magnitude faster to produce and consume compared to a text format, and has a smaller data footprint.

**Most systems follow a similar progression of data needs**:

| Stage                               | Data Choice                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| New project                         | JSON, because it's the ubiquitous go-to format. |
| Your costs begin to rise            | JSON-compatible binary format as a drop-in replacement, for lower processing and transmission costs (such as BONJSON). |
| Your needs expand beyond basic data | A more advanced binary format specific to your use case (such as Protobufs). |



BONJSON is Small, Simple, and Speedy
------------------------------------

### Designed for simplicity and efficiency

 * No compression tricks like histograms or references or lookups. Leave that to the _real_ compression algorithms.
 * Use existing, CPU-native data encodings as much as possible.
 * Encode the most common data using the smallest encoding overhead.
 * Be computationally simple.

### Easy to implement

 * [The BONJSON specification](bonjson.md) is only 600 lines long (including formal grammar).
 * [The C reference implementation](https://github.com/kstenerud/ksbonjson) is less than 500 LOC each for the encoder and decoder
